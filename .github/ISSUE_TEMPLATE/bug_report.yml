      X looked like Z instead, then threw an error. Here is the backtrace:

      ```
      Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Beep Boop")
        error("Beep Boop")
        pp-eval-expression((error "Beep Boop"))
        \#<subr funcall-interactively>(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
        apply(#<subr funcall-interactively> (pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop")))
        funcall-interactively(pp-eval-expression (error "Beep Boop"))
